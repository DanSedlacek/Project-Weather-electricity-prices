# Project-Weather-electricity-prices
Welcome to our Python project for “Data Processing in Python” (JEM207) aimed at exploring the relationship between weather conditions and market electricity spot prices in Germany. Given that Germany's energy mix is predominantly comprised of renewables, weather should be a significant factor influencing electricity spot prices. We prepared a module that allows users to input historical weather data for the preceding day, potentially also with forecasts for upcoming days. The module will analyze historical weather data and identify days when weather conditions closely resemble the provided input. The ultimate goal is to provide users with predictions of electricity prices based on historical trends associated with similar weather conditions.

Due to the nature of market dynamics, we have decided not to use conventional regression-bassed predictions, mainly due to the high complexity and data resource demand. 

Join us on this exciting journey, and let us explore together the impact of weather on market electricity spot prices in Germany!
